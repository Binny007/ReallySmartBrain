# ReallySmartBrain using Machine Learning

So i want to demonstrate this project using ImageAI library.
		--> An open-source python library built to empower developers to build applications and systems with self-contained Deep Learning and Computer Vision capabilities using simple and few lines of code. That is, instead of we having to build a Computer Vision Model a from scratch, we can use pre-existing ImageAI library which is freely access to us, to 
solve a business problem.


--> So we are going to create a image recognition app using Machine Learning, where we feed it some photos and it's going to tell us exactly what that image has.



--> So in the code, when we loop through, says that we want 5 results of your predictions, and grab the predictions and the probabilities that is the confidence that you have in these predictions.

--> So ideally we created a model that is useful enough to derive some sort of business outcomes or positive business outcomes.
